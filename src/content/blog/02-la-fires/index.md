#### Finding Hope Amid the Flames

The recent fires in Los Angeles have been a stark reminder of the challenges our city faces. Watching friends and neighbors endure evacuations and smoky skies has been both heartbreaking and humbling. It’s a moment that underscores the resilience of our community and the importance of supporting one another during difficult times.
