I’m a self-taught developer with 3.5 years of experience at Goop, where I honed my skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and PHP. My passion lies in solving complex problems, crafting intuitive user experiences, and constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of web development.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me immersed in sports—cheering on my favorite F1, NBA, or NFL teams or enjoying a round of golf. Music is another big part of my life, and I love relaxing with great tunes, spending time with loved ones, and unwinding after a productive day.

This blog is built with Astro, a framework I’ve been exploring for its speed and simplicity. I’m documenting my journey with Astro here, and I’m excited to share my thoughts and projects along the way. Here’s an awesome lo-fi mix I’ve been listening to while I work—it’s perfect for staying in the zone:
