#### Why I wanted better notes

One of my personal goals for 2025 is to start taking better notes—not just for jotting down quick ideas, but to truly organize my thoughts, track my projects, and build a system I can rely on. At my previous role at Goop, one of the most talented people I worked with, James, recommended Obsidian—a powerful note-taking tool designed to bring structure to scattered ideas. At the time, I procrastinated on trying it out, but as my workflow expanded, the need for a better system became impossible to ignore.

For years, my notes were scattered—across random apps, sticky notes, and notebooks. While this approach worked for quick reminders, it wasn't scalable for managing projects or organizing my thoughts effectively. I knew I needed a better system to bring order to the chaos

#### Researching note-taking tools

When I finally committed to improving my note-taking, I explored the most popular tools and quickly narrowed it down to two contenders: [Notion](https://www.notion.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Both are powerful and have passionate communities, but they take very different approaches to note-taking.

###### Notion

* What I liked
    * **Versatility**: Notion combines databases, task management, and notes in one platform.
    * **Visual design**: The drag-and-drop interface makes layouts easy to customize.
    * **Collaboration**: Great for teams with robust sharing features.
* What I didn't like
    * **Internet dependency**: No offline access, which can be frustrating.
    * **Overhead for simple notes**: The interface is powerful but overwhelming for quick, straightforward tasks.

###### Obsidian

* What I liked
    * **Offline first**: Everything is stored locally, meaning it works fast even on older devices, with no reliance on internet connectivity.
    * **Extensibility**: Obsidian offers incredible flexibility with its plugin ecosystem, allowing for custom themes and tools tailored to individual workflows.
    * **Markdown simplicity**: Writing with Markdown is intuitive and keeps formatting clean without needing a mouse or complex UI.
    * **Data control**: All notes are saved as local files, ensuring full ownership of content regardless of software changes.
* What I didn't like
    * **Learning curve**: While Markdown isn't an issue for me, I can see it being intimidating for those who aren't familiar with it.
    * **Mobile experience**: While usable, the mobile app feels less polished compared to Notion.
    * **Setup effort**: Advanced features require plugins, which means time spent exploring and configuring.

#### The winner: Obsidian

In the end, Obsidian's offline-first nature, Markdown support, and flexibility made it the clear winner for me.

Working offline is a game-changer—my notes are stored locally for faster performance and complete control over my data. Markdown adds another layer of efficiency, letting me format notes quickly without relying on a complex interface.

While Obsidian offers a paid sync option, I opted for the [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save/) community plugin to sync my notes through Dropbox. It was simple to set up, cost-effective, and keeps my notes seamlessly synced between my desktop (Windows) and phone (iPhone), ensuring they're always accessible.

Lastly, I loved Obsidian's simplicity. It gives me the tools I need without unnecessary distractions, while still offering the option to expand its functionality through plugins. For someone looking to organize their thoughts without a lot of overhead, Obsidian was the perfect fit.

#### Mix of the Day

Music is an essential part of my day—it flavors my world, makes me feel invincible, and inspires me to see things differently. Different genres bring out different emotions: some fuel creativity, others bring calm, and some energize me to tackle anything.

For me, liquid drum & bass strikes a perfect balance between focus and relaxation. It's atmospheric, richly melodic, and often incorporates sampled piano or guitar melodies, giving it an organic, uplifting feel. If you're looking for something to keep you in the zone while working or studying, give this mix a try—it's been a favorite of mine this week:
