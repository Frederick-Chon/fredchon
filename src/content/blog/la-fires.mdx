#### Finding Hope Amid the Flames

The recent fires in Los Angeles have been a stark reminder of the challenges our city faces. Watching friends and neighbors endure evacuations and smoky skies has been both heartbreaking and humbling. It’s a moment that underscores the resilience of our community and the importance of supporting one another during difficult times.

There are many ways to help—donating to relief funds, supporting local firefighters, or even using tech to spread helpful resources. Small actions can make a big difference in rebuilding and creating a safer future for our city.

While these events leave a mark, they also show the strength of our community. Together, we can rise above adversity and work toward a more sustainable future for Los Angeles.
